    <p><strong>Gun Violence</strong></p>

    <p>I centered my photomontages on the issue of school gun violence and the psychological impact it has on students. Rather than depicting the event itself, I chose to focus on the emotional aftermath—fear, instability, and the long-term mental health struggles that young people face in environments that should feel safe. The montage incorporates images of crying eyes, a gun, a prison cell, a brain marked with “mental health,” and the text “Stop Gun Violence.” These elements work together to express how school violence disrupts a student’s sense of security and transforms familiar spaces into places of fear. The dark, muted tones throughout the compositions reinforce the heaviness of the subject matter, while the close-up of the crying eyes serves as the emotional center, symbolizing the anxiety and helplessness many students experience in the wake of such incidents.</p>

    <p>In creating these photomontages, I used careful masking, layering, and blending to construct a visual narrative that reflects the internal tension caused by school violence. Blending modes such as Multiply and Difference allowed me to merge elements like the brain texture and the prison bars into the shadows of the composition, emphasizing how mental health deterioration often remains unseen beneath the surface. Scale and placement were used intentionally to create rhythm and draw attention to the eyes, which anchor the viewer’s emotional response. The images used came from public-domain sources and various online resources, combined to create a cohesive yet unsettling atmosphere. Through these technical choices, I aimed to portray the persistent psychological burden that school gun violence imposes on students and to highlight the need for stronger preventive action and mental health support.</p>
