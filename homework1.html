    <h1>Homework #1 – Personal Statement</h1>

    <p><strong>Statement:</strong> I'm Anjila Raya, an Emerging Media major exploring the intersection of design, storytelling, and technology. I’m drawn to visual storytelling because of its power to shape how we understand our world—from the smallest moments of daily life to the bigger ideas that influence culture and identity. Right now, I’m learning tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML, and with each new skill, I’m discovering how design can speak without words and tell stories that resonate.</p>

    <p>Much of my inspiration comes from modern design trends, digital media, and personal experiences. I’m especially interested in how media influences perception—how colors, layout, motion, or even a simple interactive element can change how we feel or think. As I grow in this field, I aim to create work that feels both thoughtful and accessible—pieces that invite curiosity, reflection, and connection. This portfolio marks the beginning of that journey, and I look forward to seeing how my ideas evolve with each new project.</p>
