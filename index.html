            <p>I chose a wooden house with a village background with nature for my homework because it shows a peaceful life close to nature and looks simple and beautiful. It also helped me use basic shapes and colors to clearly show houses and natural surroundings. I used three colors in my image and used the paintbrush and eraser tools to create proper lining. I used square and triangle shapes in my drawing.</p>

        <p>Photography and image making are important to me because they help me tell stories. When I take a picture or create a graphic, I am not just saving a moment. I am choosing what I want people to notice. I decide what to focus on, what to leave out, and what feeling I want the viewer to have. This makes image making a very personal and thoughtful process.</p>

        <p>When I read Susan Sontag’s On Photography, I understood even more how powerful images can be. Sontag wrote about photography long before smartphones existed, but her ideas still feel true today. She talked about how photos are everywhere and how they influence the way we think about the world. Today, images spread even faster because of social media. We see thousands of pictures every day. Because of that, I feel like I should be intentional when I create an image. I want to think about what message I am sending and how someone else might interpret it.</p>

        <p>This semester, I will be working on ten different projects. Each one will ask me to use different tools and different ways of making images. Even though the projects are separate, I want to see them as a collection, like chapters in a story. I hope that as I move from one project to the next, I can see myself improving. I want to understand what kind of creator I am becoming and how my ideas grow over time.</p>

        <p>When I think about the world right now, I notice how fast everything changes. I also notice how technology affects our lives. People are more connected than ever, but sometimes we still feel lonely. These are things I want to explore through my images. With photography, I can capture real moments—people walking, the way light hits a street, or a quiet scene at home. With illustration, I can show things that are harder to photograph, like emotions or ideas. And when I mix images with text, I can create a message that feels stronger and clearer.</p>

        <p>Making images also teaches me to pay attention. It makes me look closely at everyday life and notice details I might usually ignore. It helps me see how people move through the world and how different environments make us feel. It also helps me understand the power of representation—how people are shown and why it matters.</p>

        <p>Throughout this course, I hope to improve not just my technical skills but also my way of thinking. I want to create images that are meaningful and honest. I want to express ideas clearly and respectfully. I want to use my work to make people think or feel something.</p>

        <p>In the end, photography and image making help me understand myself and the world around me. They help me communicate in a way that I cannot always do with words. As I complete each project this semester, I hope to grow more confident in my voice as a media maker and continue to build a body of work that reflects who I am and what I care about.</p>

    <div id="reflection2Content" style="display:none;" class="reflection">
        <p><strong>Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</strong></p>

        <p>I chose Memunatu’s story from Motherhood in Crisis. The illustrations in her narrative depict her long, treacherous journey to reach medical care, using stylized imagery to emphasize the physical and emotional strain she experiences. Unlike the photographs in the piece, which capture real moments with factual detail, the illustrations allow the creators to visualize internal emotions, fear, and exhaustion in ways that a camera cannot. The exaggerated lines, color contrasts, and compositional focus in the drawings convey urgency and tension, guiding the viewer’s attention to Memunatu’s struggle in a symbolic and emotional way. Compared to text-only storytelling, illustrations make these experiences immediately visceral, helping the reader empathize with her journey, while also complementing photography by filling in gaps that literal images might miss, such as personal perspective, subjective experience, and the psychological weight of motherhood under crisis.</p>

        <p>Reading and viewing Memunatu’s story left a strong impression on me. I found myself deeply moved by the immense challenges she faces simply to access basic medical care, and it made me reflect on the inequalities in healthcare that exist around the world. The combination of illustrations, text, and photography allowed me to connect with her experience on a personal level, making her fears and struggles feel real and urgent. It also made me appreciate how storytelling through visuals can capture emotions and experiences that words alone sometimes cannot, helping the audience not just understand, but truly empathize. Personally, it reminded me to value the resources and support available in my own life, and inspired me to think about how visual media can be used to raise awareness about critical social issues like maternal health.</p>

        <p><strong>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</strong>, by W. J. Hennigan, NY Times</p>

        <p>Reading the New York Times interactive feature on nuclear war was both eye-opening and unsettling. It made me realize that nuclear conflict is not just a historical issue from the Cold War, but a real risk today. The article clearly explains how tensions in places like Eastern Europe, the Korean Peninsula, and East Asia could potentially escalate, and how even a limited nuclear strike could have devastating global consequences. I was especially struck by the discussion of how such an event would not only cause immediate destruction but could also disrupt the environment, destroy crops, and create long-lasting human suffering worldwide. It really made me think about how interconnected our world is. I found the part about government preparedness very interesting. It shows that preventing nuclear war is not only about deterrence but also about careful planning, monitoring, and coordination. Governments are thinking ahead stockpiling medical supplies, preparing emergency plans, and establishing communication strategies because even small mistakes could have enormous consequences. This made me appreciate how much careful thought and effort goes into keeping the world safe from nuclear escalation.</p>

        <p>The article also made it clear that nuclear prevention is not something any one country can handle alone. Strong international cooperation, diplomacy, and transparency are essential. Strengthening treaties, improving communication between nuclear powers, and having clear conflict-resolution systems are all steps that could prevent misunderstandings from turning into catastrophe. I realized that preventing nuclear war isn’t just a political or military challenge, it's a moral responsibility, and it requires ongoing attention from leaders and citizens alike. Another aspect that stood out to me was the role of education and awareness in nuclear prevention. By informing people about the real consequences of nuclear conflict, we can create a culture where the public pressures governments to prioritize peace and diplomacy. The article also made me consider how technological advancements, such as satellite monitoring and early-warning systems, could both help prevent accidents but also increase the speed at which decisions must be made, highlighting the need for careful human oversight.</p>

        <p>Reading this interactive made me think deeply about the role each of us can play, even indirectly, in supporting a safer world. Being informed, encouraging dialogue, and understanding the stakes are all important. Overall, the article left me with a sense of urgency but also hope: while the risk is real, there are concrete steps we can take to prevent nuclear disaster. It reminded me that awareness, preparedness, and cooperation are key to ensuring the safety of current and future generations. Finally, the interactive reinforced the idea that nuclear risk is not abstract, it is immediate and multidimensional, affecting not just governments but the environment, global food security, and ordinary people’s lives. Recognizing this interconnectedness makes the importance of preventive action even clearer.</p>
