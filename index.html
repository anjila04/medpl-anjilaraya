        <h3>Reflection:</h3>
        <div class="reflection">
          <p>
            Reading the first chapter of Susan Sontag’s <em>On Photography</em> changed how I think about taking pictures. 
            Sontag argues that photography involves more than just recording; it’s also about observing and interpreting the world. 
            Photography links reality to our perception of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, creating photographs and graphics goes beyond a technical skill. It’s a way to explore and share my view of the world. 
            Every image I create reflects both reality and my interpretation. Choices about framing, composition, and what to include or exclude shape the image's story. 
            A photograph captures a moment in time while expressing my intention and perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each project gives me a chance to experiment with new ideas in visual storytelling. Sontag points out that cameras have been everywhere, even before smartphones. 
            Today, images are made and viewed constantly. This makes it crucial to be intentional. I want my work to do more than just look appealing. I aim for it to inspire thought, curiosity, and conversation. 
            Combining photography with illustration, design, or text can add layers of meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Photography and digital images help me navigate today’s complicated world. Our reality feels connected yet divided, heavily influenced by technology. 
            Images can reveal these truths in ways that words cannot. I want to explore themes like identity, social justice, the environment, memory, and the blend of virtual and real life. 
            Even small projects, like portraits or edited scenes, can communicate ideas about time, perception, and human experience. Sontag notes that taking photos can create a sense of ownership. 
            This reminds me to approach my work ethically and responsibly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating images helps me understand the world and share that understanding with others. Each photograph, illustration, or mixed media piece contributes to a personal and shared narrative. 
            Over time, my projects will reflect my perspective and growth. I want to investigate connections and differences among my projects. 
            By the end of the semester, I hope to produce work that demonstrates both skill and thoughtful engagement with social and cultural issues. 
            Photography and image-making are ways to see, think, and communicate.

    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm Anjila Raya, an Emerging Media major exploring the intersection of design, storytelling, and technology. 
      I’m drawn to visual storytelling because of its power to shape how we understand our world—from the smallest moments of daily life to the bigger ideas that influence culture and identity. 
      Right now, I’m learning tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and HTML, and with each new skill, I’m discovering how design can speak without words and tell stories that resonate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of my inspiration comes from modern design trends, digital media, and personal experiences. I’m especially interested in how media influences perception on how colors, layout, motion, or even a simple interactive element can change how we feel or think. 
      As I grow in this field, I aim to create work that feels both thoughtful and accessible—pieces that invite curiosity, reflection, and connection. 
      This portfolio marks the beginning of that journey, and I look forward to seeing how my ideas evolve with each new project.
