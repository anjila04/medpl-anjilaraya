            <p>I chose Memunatu’s story from <em>Motherhood in Crisis</em>. The illustrations in her narrative depict her long, treacherous journey to reach medical care, using stylized imagery to emphasize the physical and emotional strain she experiences. Unlike the photographs in the piece, which capture real moments with factual detail, the illustrations allow the creators to visualize internal emotions, fear, and exhaustion in ways that a camera cannot. The exaggerated lines, color contrasts, and compositional focus in the drawings convey urgency and tension, guiding the viewer’s attention to Memunatu’s struggle in a symbolic and emotional way. Compared to text-only storytelling, illustrations make these experiences immediately visceral, helping the reader empathize with her journey, while also complementing photography by filling in gaps that literal images might miss, such as personal perspective, subjective experience, and the psychological weight of motherhood under crisis.</p>

            <p>Reading and viewing Memunatu’s story left a strong impression on me. I found myself deeply moved by the immense challenges she faces simply to access basic medical care, and it made me reflect on the inequalities in healthcare that exist around the world. The combination of illustrations, text, and photography allowed me to connect with her experience on a personal level, making her fears and struggles feel real and urgent. It also made me appreciate how storytelling through visuals can capture emotions and experiences that words alone sometimes cannot, helping the audience not just understand, but truly empathize. Personally, it reminded me to value the resources and support available in my own life, and inspired me to think about how visual media can be used to raise awareness about critical social issues like maternal health.</p>

    <!-- Reflection 3 -->
    <div class="card">
        <h3><a href="#" id="toggleReflection3">Reflection #3: The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It →</a></h3>
        <div id="reflection3Content" style="display:none;" class="reflection">
            <p>Reading the New York Times interactive feature on nuclear war was both eye-opening and unsettling. It made me realize that nuclear conflict is not just a historical issue from the Cold War, but a real risk today. The article clearly explains how tensions in places like Eastern Europe, the Korean Peninsula, and East Asia could potentially escalate, and how even a limited nuclear strike could have devastating global consequences. I was especially struck by the discussion of how such an event would not only cause immediate destruction but could also disrupt the environment, destroy crops, and create long-lasting human suffering worldwide. It really made me think about how interconnected our world is.</p>

            <p>I found the part about government preparedness very interesting. It shows that preventing nuclear war is not only about deterrence but also about careful planning, monitoring, and coordination. Governments are thinking ahead—stockpiling medical supplies, preparing emergency plans, and establishing communication strategies—because even small mistakes could have enormous consequences. This made me appreciate how much careful thought and effort goes into keeping the world safe from nuclear escalation.</p>

            <p>The article also made it clear that nuclear prevention is not something any one country can handle alone. Strong international cooperation, diplomacy, and transparency are essential. Strengthening treaties, improving communication between nuclear powers, and having clear conflict-resolution systems are all steps that could prevent misunderstandings from turning into catastrophe. I realized that preventing nuclear war isn’t just a political or military challenge, it’s a moral responsibility, and it requires ongoing attention from leaders and citizens alike.</p>

            <p>Another aspect that stood out to me was the role of education and awareness in nuclear prevention. By informing people about the real consequences of nuclear conflict, we can create a culture where the public pressures governments to prioritize peace and diplomacy. The article also made me consider how technological advancements, such as satellite monitoring and early-warning systems, could help prevent accidents but also increase the speed at which decisions must be made, highlighting the need for careful human oversight.</p>

            <p>Overall, the article left me with a sense of urgency but also hope. While the risk is real, there are concrete steps we can take to prevent nuclear disaster. It reminded me that awareness, preparedness, and cooperation are key to ensuring the safety of current and future generations.</p>
