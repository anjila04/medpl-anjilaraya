    <p><strong>Cyberbullying</strong></p>

    <p>My photomontage is about cyberbullying and how it affects people emotionally. The main image is a girl looking stressed while using her phone, showing how online harassment can make someone feel upset or anxious. Around her, I added social media icons, notifications, “dislike” buttons, and bad comments to show the negative messages that people often receive online. I made the colors darker using hue and saturation to create a serious and tense mood. By putting these elements together, I wanted to show how cyberbullying can feel overwhelming and hurtful.

        

I used masking in Photoshop to carefully combine all the images so they fit together naturally. The girl was masked so the background and social media elements could appear around her. I used blending modes like Overlay and Soft Light on the icons and comments to make them look like part of the scene and I decreased the opacity. I changed the size and placement of each element to make the image balanced and interesting. Most of my images came from public domain sources. These techniques helped me show how cyberbullying surrounds and affects the person.
