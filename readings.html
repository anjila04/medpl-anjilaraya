    <h2>Homework #2 — Reflection on Photography & Image Making</h2>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

    <p>Photography and image making are important to me because they help me tell stories. When I take a picture or create a graphic, I am not just saving a moment. I am choosing what I want people to notice. I decide what to focus on, what to leave out, and what feeling I want the viewer to have. This makes image making a very personal process.</p>

    <p>When I read Susan Sontag’s <em>On Photography</em>, I learned how powerful images can be. She wrote about photography before smartphones existed, but her ideas still feel true today. She explained how photos are everywhere and shape the way people understand the world. Today, with social media, images spread even faster. Because of that, I try to be intentional with what I create. I want to think about what message I am sending and how someone might understand it.</p>

    <p>This semester, I will be working on ten different projects. Each one uses different tools and methods. Even though the projects are separate, I want to see them as a collection. I hope that as I move from one project to the next, I can see my growth. I want to notice how my ideas change and how my style develops.</p>

    <p>When I think about the world right now, I notice how fast everything changes and how technology affects our lives. We are very connected, yet sometimes people still feel lonely. These are the ideas I want to show in my images. With photography, I can capture real life—people walking, city streets, or quiet moments. With illustration, I can show emotions or ideas that are harder to photograph. When I combine images with text, I can communicate a message more clearly.</p>

    <p>Making images helps me pay attention to the world. It makes me notice small details and understand how people move through their environments. It also helps me think about representation—how people are shown and why that matters.</p>

    <p>Throughout this course, I want to improve my skills and also my way of thinking. I want to make images that are meaningful and honest. I want to express myself clearly and respectfully. I hope my work makes people think or feel something.</p>

    <p>In the end, photography and image making help me understand myself and the world. They help me communicate in a way that words sometimes cannot. As I complete each project this semester, I hope to grow more confident as a creator and build a body of work that represents who I am and what I care about.</p>
