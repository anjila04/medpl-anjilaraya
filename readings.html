    <h2>Homework #2 — Reflection on Photography & Image Making</h2>

    <p><strong>Reflection — Photography, Image Making, and Meaning</strong></p>

    <p>Photography has always been more than just a way to record a moment for me; it is a way of translating the world into something I can understand, shape, and share. After reading Susan Sontag’s opening chapter of <em>On Photography</em>, I began thinking about how cameras have become extensions of how we see. Even before smartphones made photography effortless, Sontag described the camera as something constantly present—an object that changes how people interact with reality. Today, images are created faster and more frequently than ever, but Sontag’s ideas still ring true. Taking a photograph is never neutral; it is a choice, a framing, a way of deciding what matters in that second.</p>

    <p>When I take photos or create graphics, I’m aware that I’m doing more than just capturing what’s in front of me—I’m selecting a point of view. I’m making decisions about composition, color, focus, and emotion. These choices create meaning. In a sense, every image is a small argument about how the world looks or how it <em>should</em> look. As a media maker, I want to use photography not just to document but to interpret. Photography gives me the freedom to show how I felt in a moment, not only what was physically there.</p>

    <p>Throughout the semester, we will be creating ten different projects using multiple tools. Even though each project is separate, I think they will form a connected body of work because they all come from my perspective. Sontag’s writing reminds me that every image carries intention. One project might focus on color, another on layout, another on editing, but all of them reflect how I see the world. I want to use this semester to build a visual language that’s uniquely mine.</p>

    <p>If I were to represent our current world visually—through photography, illustration, or text-image combinations—I would focus on contrast. The contrast between digital and physical life, chaos and calm, information overload and quiet moments. I’m interested in subtle details: light, patterns, textures, moments people overlook. Those can communicate emotion just as powerfully as dramatic scenes.</p>

    <p>Image making helps me pay attention. It encourages me to notice framing, relationships, and emotional tones. This semester, I hope to grow not only in technical skill but in the ability to communicate visually in thoughtful, layered ways.</p>
