    <h2>Homework #2 — Reflection on Photography & Image Making</h2>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

    <p>For me, taking a photo or creating an image isn’t just about capturing a moment. It’s more like telling a story. When I take a picture, I decide what to show, how to show it, and what I want people to feel when they see it. It’s like I’m choosing a perspective and framing a small world for someone else to see.</p>

    <p>I was reading Susan Sontag, and she talks about how photography is everywhere. Even before smartphones, she noticed that images are very powerful. They can inform people, persuade them, or even manipulate them. Now, with social media, this power is huge. Every day, millions of images are shared online. So, when I create images, I feel like I have a responsibility to think about what the picture says and how it might affect someone who sees it.</p>

    <p>This semester, I have ten projects. Each project is different, but I like to think of them as connected. Each one helps me learn new skills and explore different ways of creating. By the end, I want my projects to show a story or a theme that runs through all of them. I want to see how my ideas and style grow from one project to the next.</p>

    <p>Right now, I want to capture what our world feels like today. I’m interested in how people live, how technology affects us, and the balance between being connected and feeling isolated. Photography lets me show real life, like streets, cities, or small moments. Illustration lets me explore ideas or feelings in a more abstract way. And sometimes, combining images with text can give more meaning and make people think.</p>

    <p>For me, photography and making images is also about paying attention. It helps me see the world more closely and understand other people’s experiences. It also makes me think about what pictures mean and how they affect society. Through this semester, I hope to improve not just my skills, but also the way I communicate ideas visually and thoughtfully.</p>
